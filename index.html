<h2 class="first">Carol Dwek</h2>
From her video, it can be assumed Carol Dwek believes in two main mindsets for indiviuals. The Fixed Mindset and Growth Mindset, Fixed Mindset being where someone thinks all knowledge is placed at a fixed rate since they were born. A Growth Mindset however is where someone believes intelligence can be deveoloped by putting the brain through "Trials" or something similar. Her and Derek Muller both believe that the brain requires these mental trials to give people knowledge, but she is the only one to talk about the fixed mindset. The idea of a fixed midnset is important here because she believes it makes kids "Afraid" or makes them "Feel Down." Then there was her 3 mindset rules, her growth rules matched up really well with Derek's ideology. One of these growth mindset rules being "mistakes and mishaps" shape your brain and enhance your knowledge. Something Derek indirectly speaks about.

    <h2 class="second">Derek Muller</h2>
From his videos, Derek Muller clearly thinks it isn't the fault of humans and having a bad mindset, like with Carol Dwek and her "Fixed Mindset." Instead he can be seen talking about how the school system is one of the main faults for humans and their lack of knowledge in certain areas. As well as the fact he thinks people just can't learn from having the information just said in front of them. Thinking people instead feel like they are learning and become more confident in their thoughts. He believes, similar to Carol, that people need to be wrong before they can be right/learn at all. He goes as far as quoting Richard Phillips Feynman saying "First principle is to not fool yourself. And that you are the easiest to fool."

<h2 class="third">My Thoughts</h2>
I agree more with the ideas Derek then Carol. I don't think there is a thing as the "Fixed Mindset" as even in her own studies she proves just how faulty the idea is, since they proved it is possible to get rid of their "Fixed Mindset." While this doesn't disprove the idea of the Foxed Mindset, it makes it less likely. Derek says that everyone can pretty much clear up the stuff fthey remember wrong.
